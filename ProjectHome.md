HMA Architecture Working Group

Based on the OGC standard:
  * OGC 13-039 OpenSearch Extension for Earth Observation Satellite Tasking Implementation

Feasibility server is implemented in Java based on the ESA EO-CFI libraries.

The HMA Projects are overviewed by the HMA Architecture Working Group HMA AWG and the Ground Segment Coordination Body (GSCB). Information about the Heterogeneous Missions Access Architecture Working Group and related meetings is available at the HMA AWG page.

The GSCB was created to ensure that contributions to GMES adopt a common, coordinated and cost-effective approach that responds to the needs of Earth observation users. View the GSCB Report 2009.
